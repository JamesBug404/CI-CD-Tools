# CI-CD-Tools

## In business or technical terms describe your understanding of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD)? 
Continuous integration means developers merge their changes back to the main branch as often as possible. The developer's changes are validated by creating a build and running automated tests against the build. Continuous integration puts a great emphasis on testing automation to check that the application is not broken whenever new commits are integrated into the main branch. Continuous delivery is an extension of continuous integration since it automatically deploys all code changes to a testing and/or production environment after the build stage. This means that on top of automated testing, you have an automated release process, and you can deploy your application any time by clicking a button. In theory, with continuous delivery, you can decide to release daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whatever suits your business requirements.

## What are some tools that are used for this and why are they used?
GitLab, GitHub, Jenkins, AWS Code Commit or Azure Pipelines are used for CI/CD. As teams increasingly embrace DevOps to support market demand for quicker fixes, shorter release cycles, and high-quality software code, CI/CD tools can help a team automate their development, deployment, and testing. CI/CD tools also report the status of deployment steps, allowing DevOps engineers to track the health and status of their deployment pipelines. The right CI/CD tools will help DevOps engineers spend less time on integration and delivery and more time on developing a quality product.
